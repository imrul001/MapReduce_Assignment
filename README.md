# Matrix-Matrix Multiplication By Hadoop-MapReduce
This repository is for MapReduce Programs Only.. 
MV is the Matrix Vector Multiplication and MM is the Matrix Matrix Multiplication. 

MATRIX VECTOR MULTIPLICATION:
Here the dimentions of matrix and verctor are sent through the input file(not passed as parameter). 

MATRIX MATRIX MULTIPLICATION:
Here the dimentions are passed as arguments(through JonConf) from the driver class(default 2-by-2 for both Matrix).   
Therefore, configurations should be changed in driver class for different dimentions,
